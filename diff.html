  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently in my second year of a Master’s degree in Translation at the University of Liège, where I am also pursuing a double Master’s in Translation and Interpreting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally from Romania, I moved to Spain at the age of two and grew up bilingual in Romanian and Spanish. This early immersion in languages allowed me to develop a strong aptitude for language learning. I later acquired English rapidly and reached a C2 level at the age of 18.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Translation and Conference Interpreting at the University of Madrid. My Bachelor’s thesis focused on artificial intelligence, with particular attention to automatic post‑editing and the role of AI in translation workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my Bachelor’s studies and my Erasmus exchange at the University of Liège, I achieved full professional proficiency in French, which led me to return to Liège to continue my academic and professional development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also speak Norwegian and travel to Norway every summer. It is a country that deeply inspires me and where I would like to live in the future.

  <h2>Translation & Interpreting in the Age of AI</h2>
  <p>
    I strongly believe that translators and interpreters cannot work against artificial intelligence — they must work with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI is not a threat but a tool: one that can be integrated into daily professional practice to improve productivity, consistency, and quality, when used critically and ethically.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a rapidly evolving industry, language professionals must continuously adapt, evolve, and engage in lifelong learning. Continuous education is no longer optional — it is a core part of the profession.
